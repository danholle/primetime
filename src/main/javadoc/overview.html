    This webapp searches for large prime numbers in the background on a web server.
    A website provides visibility into the progress of the search.

    In the first half century of digital computing, the biggest super-computers the world 
    over were used by researchers to find bigger and bigger primes.  Then, in 1996, there
    was a paradigm shift:  the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) came into 
    being, wherein thousands of volunteers would run prime tests on their PC's, coordinated
    over the Internet.  Every Mersenne prime since has come from GIMPS.
    <p>
    primetime is another angle on both of these.  I think I can replicate the work done
    by all those supercomputers, over a period of half a century, on my PC in less than a year.
