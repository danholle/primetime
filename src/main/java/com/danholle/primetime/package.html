      The "primetime" package is a set of Java tools for finding Mersenne
      primes... and, specifically, a webapp for searching incessantly for 
      such primes, and presenting the status of the search as the search
      continues.
      <p>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      Here is the overall flow.
      <ul>
        <li>When the web server (typically Tomcat) comes up, it starts "task", which sets up and executes the background 
          search for large primes.
          <ul>
            <li>"task" initiates a "qthread" which runs in the background.
            <li>"qthread", in turn, uses "putils" to do the real work.
          </ul>
        <li>There is a log file that captures results.  This log file is consulted on startup to resume 
          where we left off.
          <ul>
            <li>"quest" is an object that captures the current state of the computation.  It is initialized 
              from the log file, and is referenced by the web app to display current state.
          </ul>
        <li>The actual webapp is presented through a single page, with custom tags to display the state of the search.
          These custom tags are:  sofar, summary, latest.
      </ul>
